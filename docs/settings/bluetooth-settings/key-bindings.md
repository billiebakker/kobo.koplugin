# Key Bindings

When you connect a Bluetooth device that has buttons (like a remote control or keyboard), you can
configure which buttons trigger which KOReader actions.

## Available Actions

You can bind buttons to the following actions:

- **Decrease Font Size** - Makes text smaller
- **Increase Font Size** - Makes text larger
- **Next Chapter** - Navigate to next chapter
- **Next Page** - Turn to next page
- **Previous Chapter** - Navigate to previous chapter
- **Previous Page** - Turn to previous page
- **Show Menu** - Open the KOReader menu
- **Toggle Bookmark** - Add or remove bookmark at current position
- **Toggle Frontlight** - Turn frontlight on/off

## Configuring Key Bindings

To set up button mappings for a connected device:

1. Navigate to Settings → Network → Bluetooth → Paired devices
2. Select the device you want to configure
3. Choose "Configure key bindings"
4. Select an action from the list
5. Choose "Register button"
6. Press the button on your Bluetooth device you want to use for this action
7. The binding is saved automatically

Repeat steps 4-6 for each button you want to configure.

## Removing a Key Binding

To remove a button mapping:

1. Navigate to the device's key binding configuration
2. Select the action you want to unbind
3. Choose "Remove binding"

## Multiple Devices

Each Bluetooth device can have its own unique button configuration. The mappings you create for one
device won't affect other devices.

## Persistence

Key bindings are saved automatically and persist across KOReader restarts. You only need to
configure them once per device.

## Tips

- Configure the most frequently used actions first (like Next/Previous Page)
- Test each binding after configuring to ensure it works as expected
- You don't need to configure every button - only map the ones you plan to use
